# PythonImageInverter

## Description

PythonImageInverter is a simple CLI utility to invert color in images using Python and Pillow.

As a student, I prefer dark-mode and find myself manually inverting images for my notes so I am not blinded. Works for a single image or will convert any images found from a provided directory.
